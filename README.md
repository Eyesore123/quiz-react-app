# Philosopher quiz

* This is a quiz about famous quotes from well-known philosophers. 

* I turned my previous quiz that was made with vanilla JavaScript into a React app version.

* It stores the states of users' answers so the user can go back to previous questions, but there are still some issues with how answer values are stored.

* Master branch contains the latest source files. Gh-pages branch is used for static deployment.
