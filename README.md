# Philosopher quiz

* This is a quiz about the famous quotes from well-known philosophers. 

* In this project I turned my previous quiz that was made with vanilla JavaScript into a React app version.

* It stores the states so user can go back to previous questions, but there are still some issues with how answer values are stored.
